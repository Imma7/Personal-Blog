                        <p style="font-size:18px;">The history of political blogging might usefully be divided into the periods pre- and post-Huffington.
                            Before the millionaire socialite Arianna Huffington decided to get in on the act, bloggers operated
                            in a spirit of underdog solidarity. They hated the mainstream media - and the feeling was mutual.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <p style="font-size:18px;">Bloggers saw themselves as gadflies, pricking the arrogance of established elites from their home
                            computers, in their pyjamas, late into the night. So when, in 2005, Huffington decided to mobilise
                            her fortune and media connections to create, from scratch, a flagship liberal blog she was roundly
                            derided. Who, spluttered the original bloggerati, did she think she was?
                        </p>

                        <hr>
                        <br>

                        <p style="font-size:18px;">But the pyjama purists were confounded. Arianna's money talked just as loudly online as off, and
                            the Huffington Post quickly became one of the most influential and popular journals on the web.
                            It recruited professional columnists and celebrity bloggers. It hoovered up traffic. Its launch
                            was a landmark moment in the evolution of the web because it showed that many of the old rules
                            still applied to the new medium: a bit of marketing savvy and deep pockets could go just as far
                            as geek credibility, and get there faster.</p>
